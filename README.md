# Bible Lib

_Note_ This library is unfinished, so use it as a stepping-stone for your own application or wait until a more stable version is out.

## What is this?
A library for interacting with and parsing the data within the bible.

The purpose of this is to work with a large dataset, parse it, and compare data. My goal is to utilize this within a GUI application and for others to be able to do as they with the library.

*Note*
This utilizes the Luke Smith edited version of the KJV bible for testing purposes. In the future I plan for it to consume API data and built data structured in a similar way for offline consumption.

## Usage
Using your Clojure REPL you can test out some of the functions and see the results;

```clojure
;Example for returning the first verse in Genesis
(first (bible-lib.core/bible-data)) ;=> ["Genesis" "Ge" "1" "1" "1" "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth."]
```

Here's another example for getting the frequency of words used in the bible
```clojure
(bible-lib.core/frequency-data (bible-lib.core/bible-data))
```
